// The posture: every application's standing on every control that applies to it, one row an application, joined
// from the checked controls. The flow watches this dataset as it watches a source: its history is built from the days
// before, and what two controls do together is judged from it. A blank is a control that doesn't apply to the
// application, or one whose file had no row for it that day: the two look alike here, and telling them apart is one of
// the questions this dataset is for.
