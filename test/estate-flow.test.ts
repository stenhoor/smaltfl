/**
 * The control estate through the engine (ADR 0014, the answer key), slice by slice. Each watch's history is built from
 * mid-December to the end of February, then March's loads arrive one a day, under the gates the notebooks write (TLS's
 * in full, the others their layer's defaults) and the ontology's marks (a band on not-assessed everywhere and on WAF's
 * failures; a due mark on next_due). What each planted day is told by is asserted here, and so is what this slice
 * still gets wrong against the key: those assertions are the next slices' vectors, and move when the slice lands, as
 * a decision, not a fix.
 *
 * Slice 1 (the gate, the defaults, the rule that written checks hold and learned ones warn unless the value is bad):
 * - the empty MFA file holds on the amount; the doubled TLS file and both scope days hold on the amount too (slice 3
 *   names scope); the refused logging file is a failed run until slice 7 makes it the schema check's hold;
 * - a learned finding that isn't a bad value publishes as unusual.
 * Slice 2 (bands and due marks):
 * - the WAF collapse and the backup outage hold on their bands, said with the band;
 * - the vulnerability and access-review clusters publish: the miss is the due check's, and the pass share's fall is
 *   unusual at most; Patch Tuesday's next_due filling in is no longer a finding;
 * Slice 3 (scope and dependency rules, upstream attribution):
 * - the contradiction holds on the posture's dependency; the scope days hold on the WAF's and TLS's scope rule;
 * - the posture no longer repeats a control's finding as its own: a column named for a source is the source's to judge,
 *   and a wrong source explains the step's day.
 * Slice 4 (the kept sample and the classifier):
 * - every watch has a sample of its last eight weeks beside its history; the classifier holds nothing, is quiet on the
 *   look-alike days and the calm days, and speaks as unusual where a day's rows are unlike the like days' (the
 *   vulnerability file on Patch Tuesday, when the month's findings land).
 * Slice 5 (gold's reconciliation and the seal):
 * - the posture reconciles with the inventory (one row an application): the doubled TLS file holds the posture on its
 *   own rule beside TLS's amount, as the key has it, and nothing upstream explains a written rule away;
 * - each gold summary is reconciled by its key (by unit with the posture's units) on every run, kept in the manifest,
 *   clean on every day, and verify counts it again.
 * Slice 7 (a refused file as the schema check's hold):
 * - the day the logging file lacks a column is a held run, not a failed one: the file is recorded as refused, nothing
 *   is built, the hold says "file has 4 of 5 columns", verify finds the manifest coherent, and the next day publishes.
 * - still wrong against the key: the pentest cluster holds by the bad value and the DR problem by the new value,
 *   since with two and a half months of history neither control has had twenty due dates for the due check to
 *   learn from (the app's year of history judges both; the test's base is short for speed). The seal itself is the
 *   app's: the owner's signature on a run whose gates passed.
 * ADR 0015 §1 (the ontology says what a dataset's rows are):
 * - every control's rows are one an application, for the applications the ontology's `rows` selects: the scope of all
 *   twelve is counted (ten had none), and each file is held to its key. TLS's and the WAF's gate cells no longer write
 *   a scope. The calm days count nothing out of scope and no key twice, on every control.
 * - two rows of the answer key moved on purpose (the ADR's "What moves on the estate"): the empty MFA file keeps its
 *   head, the amount, and the scope's 600 applications with no row follow from it; the doubled TLS file is led by its
 *   key, "203 apps repeat a key" (it was the amount, "More apps: 406 (+100%)"), and the amount follows from the key.
