/**
 * Filling a paused day in the app (ADR 0009 amendment 1 S3, S4, S9, S10; Q-61, Q-64): which days the data lists that a
 * held day may be filled from, and what each option gives readers (`donorsOf`); a donor's file fetched, checked against
 * the data's list and pinned in the engine only when a fill needs it (`pinDonor`); the derived document run staged, as
 * the record keeps it (`stageRepair`, `derivedAbout`); and what a release of it, or a withdrawal, names. main.ts calls
 * these from the decision sheet and when a day is run again (applyDecided): it keeps the record and the screens, this
 * module what a fill is made of.
 *
 * Every word on screen comes from core/decision.ts; every judgement from core/fill.ts and core/hold.ts. Nothing here
 * decides what a day may be filled from: the flow's verdict does (donorChoices), and the plugin checks the release.
