/**
 * Filling a paused day (ADR 0009 amendment 1): what is missing, from which day it is filled, the derived document that
 * says so, the numbers each option gives readers, the options a held day gets, and a day's versions. Pure: no DOM, no
 * engine. The page draws the options from these; the plugin runs the derived document held, and releases it only as a
 * recorded decision says (src/plugin/release.ts).
 *
 * - The missing part comes from the flow's verdict (`flowStory`, raw names): a fall to the day's end, a gap or a late
 *   start is those hours; a part that vanished is that part; a part that held while the rest vanished is the rest.
 *   Anything else (an amount, a share, a surge, the checks alone) has nothing to fill, and neither has a day whose rows
 *   aren't below their range: the part's rows were coded another way, and a fill would count them twice (S2).
 * - The donor is a good day near the held one: the same weekday or the nearest day, before or after, within four
 *   weeks, judged with nothing wrong of it (and judged at all: never a day not judged yet), never a day the flow's
 *   calendar marks unless the held day is one, and a file in the data's list (S3). The watch's own rule comes first:
 *   the one it names, else its pattern's (ADR 0010 §3, C1).
