/**
 * What holds a run, what waits while it holds, and what was decided about it (ADR 0009). Pure: no DOM, no engine.
 *
 * - The flow's verdict on a day (`flowStory`, `dayClaim`): the story told for the flow, not for a viewer, with raw
 *   names, nothing hidden, nothing marked as expected, and every day of the history in its ranges, since those marks
 *   belong to one browser. The page passes it to the run as a claim; the plugin checks the claim against the run.
 * - What holds (`judgeClaims`, `holdsOf`): the checks, from the manifest's counts, and each watched source, from its
 *   claim, or as not judged when the claim is missing or doesn't match the run. It reads the manifest only, so a check
 *   reused by key holds again, and verify can compute the holds again from what was stored.
 * - What waits (`reachOf`, `heldOutputs`, `waitingOf`): every output while anything holds, or with `together: false`
 *   the outputs that read what the holding step reads; of those, the ones whose staged key isn't the current one.
 * - What the record says (`inputsOf`, `pausesOf`, `standingFor`, `decisionFor`): the record outlives the engine, so a
 *   pause opened by a held run is found again by the run's inputs (the flow, its parameters and its files), closed by a
 *   decision or by a passing run of the same inputs, and a decision is applied again only to the keys it named.
