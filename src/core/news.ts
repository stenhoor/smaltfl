/**
 * A day's news: what is out of the ordinary about a daily load, from its history (history.ts) against its normal
 * ranges (normal.ts), ranked, each with its evidence, where to look for more, and what can be done about it. The kinds
 * of news are the ones data-observability tools watch a table for: volume (a normal amount of data or not, a day all
 * but blank, data that stops part way through), the values (one usually there gone, one's share unusual, a value or a
 * combination of values never seen before), completeness (a column missing more values than it does), shape (a
 * measure's or a time's quantiles moved), what the checks drop, the file's columns changing, and the weather as
 * context.
 *
 * False alarms are kept down three ways: a number has to be outside its normal range (three typical misses from what a
 * day like it has, which on 2023's days holds about 96 days in a hundred), it has to matter (enough rows, and a big
 * enough change: MATERIAL), and findings that are one thing seen through several columns (the same rows missing a
 * passenger count, a rate code and a surcharge) are told once. A day with nothing to tell says so. No DOM, no engine.
