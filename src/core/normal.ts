/**
 * A day's normal range: what a daily number (a load's trips, the share its checks dropped, a column's median) would
 * be on a day like it, and how far from that is still ordinary, from the days before it alone: a day is never part
 * of its own range. As data-observability tools set an expected range for a daily metric (the same weekday's history,
 * robust statistics) and as forecasting practice combines guesses rather than picking one:
 *
 * - The weeks before: the same weekday over the six weeks before, holidays and the days around them left out (looking
 *   back up to ten weeks for six), the latest counting most and each two places back half as much; their weighted
 *   median, which no one day can make.
 * - Last year: the same weekday around this time last year (52 weeks back, and a week either side: their median, so
 *   one odd week last year doesn't make the guess), moved by how this year's days compared with last year's over the
 *   six weeks before (the median of their ratios, day by day). A holiday, or a day in a holiday's window
 *   (calendar.ts), goes by its own day last year: the same holiday, or the same day of the window; one on a date that
 *   fell on another weekday last year is moved too, for a count, by how the two weekdays compare over the weeks
 *   before (a share's or a level's is not: a holiday Monday has no rush hour). Last year's guess has to carry over: one
 *   that misses the ordinary days before by more than three times the weeks' guess does can't judge a holiday.
 * - Together: each guess weighted by how well it did over the six weeks before, as Bates and Granger combine
 *   forecasts (in inverse proportion to its squared typical miss, the larger of its miss over every day and over the
 *   same weekday's, so a guess that does well on weekdays and badly on Saturdays counts for Saturdays as it does
 *   there); a guess that misses by more than three times the other's is left out (a rule or a habit changed since last
 *   year, as the TLC's surcharges did in December 2022); else neither counts less than a fifth, since weights
 *   measured over a few weeks are rough. A holiday, or a day around one, has last year's guess alone.
 * - The range: the guess, give or take three typical misses of that combined guess over the six weeks before (the
 *   typical miss: 1.4826 times the median absolute miss, a standard deviation that a few odd days don't inflate). A
 *   holiday's typical miss is last year's guess's on the holidays of the year before.
 *
 * Counts are guessed on a log scale (a miss is a ratio), shares on a logit scale, anything else as it is. No DOM, no
 * engine: the numbers come from runs, or from the scenario's history (scripts/data/history.ts).
