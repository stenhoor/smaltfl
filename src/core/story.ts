/**

 * of listing it. newsOf (news.ts) finds what is out of the ordinary; storyOf says what it adds up to:
 *
 * - the cause, as a population or a time: the part of the trips that held and the part that moved (a split: on Fri Sep
 *   22, 2023 the Flex Fare trips arrived as usual and every other trip almost stopped), the hour the trips fall, or an
 *   amount with no part to blame;
 * - the gate: whether the flow's checks would hold the run, with the rows they drop against the rows a day like it drops
 *   (a share past its limit because the kept rows are missing reads differently from one past it because bad rows came);
 * - every finding sorted by what the cause explains: absorbed (it restates the cause), follows (the cause predicts its
 *   count), same day (untested, or the prediction missed, but no bigger than what the cause moved), standalone. New
 *   values, new pairs, schema changes and integrity never fold;
 * - the episode it is part of (day 2 since Thu 13:00), or the recovery after one;
 * - its head, chips and labels, short enough to count: the screen's words come from here.
 *
 * Severity is carried through: a folded finding is told as a note, with what it was kept. No DOM, no engine.
