/**
 * Policies (ARCHITECTURE.md §7): who may read which rows and columns, and who may run which action on which rows.
 * They compile to SQL here, in the core, so every path that reads applies the same rules: the app's previews and
 * results, the ontology's objects, an action's check, and later shares and a server.
 *
 * A row rule names the column it filters on (or several names for it, as it is called in different datasets) and
 * the principal's attribute that holds the allowed values. It applies to every dataset that has one of those columns.
 * A dataset that has none is closed to the people the rule is for: its rows can't be filtered, so none are shown.
 * That is the safe reading of inheritance until lineage carries rules exactly (Q-41). A column rule removes columns
 * by name, the ones made from them included, which it lists.
