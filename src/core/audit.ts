/**
 * Checking an audit bag (ADR 0006 §8), as an auditor does: the bag's own manifests; the record's entries against its
 * root and every signed checkpoint; every run the record names, its manifest by hash, the plan and the flow document
 * it names by theirs, the record's head it says it ran after, and each source file it read in the data's list; each
 * dataset's inclusion proof, and that the dataset is one its run made, with that content; and, given a checkpoint the
 * auditor kept, that the record is a continuation of it, signed by the same card.
 *
 * A day held by its flow (ADR 0009) is checked as an `ok` run is, and its holds against its manifest and its claims;
 * each decision against the run it decides and the policies of its flow document (who may decide, a reason for
 * publish as is, a standing decision that stands for its day); each release against the decision it cites (an earlier
 * decide entry, by its leaf, still the day's decision when it was released) and the run it releases; a proof may
 * cite a release, or a held run's entry for an output it didn't hold; and the engine's names (engine/datasets.json,
 * engine/releases.json) show only versions of runs in the record, never a held output without a release citing a
 * decision in the record. What held a run is read from the engine (engine/holds.json) as well as from the record: a
 * run the engine held, recorded as published, fails, and its outputs need a release all the same.
 *
 * A day filled, or published with the part that arrived (ADR 0009 amendment 1 S11), is checked through its derived
 * run as a held run is, and against the held run it repairs: its document is that run's repaired by the decision's
 * repair, it read the same snapshot of the watched source, and its donor's file is in the list, on a day the rule's
 * direction allows within four weeks, with a claim that says nothing wrong, told from the held run's history. A
 * release of it names the derived run and keys its decision names (`derived`), and never moves the names back past a
 * later day; a withdrawal (Q-61) amends the fill's decision and points each name back to what it showed before the
 * fill. What the engine kept of the fills (engine/repairs.json) agrees with the record.
 *
 * A bag carries its own card and its own data list, so on its own it shows only that it is consistent with itself:
 * anyone can make a bag that is. What ties it to someone is what the auditor brings: a checkpoint they kept, the
 * signer's fingerprint from its owner, and the data list from the data branch (`git show <commit>:MANIFEST.json`).
 * The script (scripts/audit.mjs) and the tests use this; nothing here needs a browser or the engine.
