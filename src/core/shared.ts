/**
 * A starting file's ontology, shared by every flow that reads the file (Q-148, the maintainer: "changes live in one
 * place and can update multiple different flows"). It says what the file's columns mean and the rules its rows are held
 * to, once, in its own document (`smaltfl-ontology/1`, `examples/ontologies/<file>.json`); a flow lists it under
 * `ontology.import`, and reading the flow (`readFlow`, scripts/flow.ts) brings it in: its columns' meanings and its
 * rules join the flow's ontology, the check cell that enforces the file lists its rules (`syncRuleCells`), and the flow
 * keeps where each came from (`ontology.shared`). Change the shared file, and every flow that imports it has the change
 * the next time it is read; the cells follow on their own (a rule a cell doesn't list is on), and `npm run rules:sync`
 * writes them on disk.
 *
 * The flow document a run hashes is the one read, with the shared file's content in it: a change to the shared file is
 * a change to every flow that imports it, recorded as such. Pure: the caller reads the files.
