/**
 * File integrity (ADR 0006 §2): what a data file the app read is, against the list the data branch publishes and
 * against what this browser's record saw before. Pure, so the app and the tests (and an auditor's script) agree.
 *
 *   same          the bytes match the list, and the record saw these same bytes before
 *   new           the bytes match the list, and the record hasn't seen this file before
 *   republished   the bytes match the list, but the list changed since the record last saw the file: the data was
 *                 rebuilt or the source republished it (amber: worth knowing, not tampering)
 *   corrupt       the bytes don't match the list: refused
 *   missing       the file isn't there (a 404): refused
 *   unlisted      the file isn't in the list at all: refused
 *   list          the list itself doesn't match the hash loads.json gives for it, or its entries disagree: refused.
 *                 loads.json is written beside the app when it is built, and served with it: it is not part of app.js,
 *                 so whoever can change the published files can change both together (only the data branch's own
 *                 history, checked by an auditor, settles which list is the published one)
 *   not-checked   the file couldn't be fetched (a network error): nothing to judge, and nothing to run on
