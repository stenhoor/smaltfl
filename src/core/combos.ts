/**
 * Discovered checks (ADR 0013): what a watched dataset's columns do together, found from its history rather than
 * written as a rule. Two judges, both read in newsOf (news.ts) beside the value and pair findings:
 *
 * - `comboNews`: each pair of counted columns, cell by cell, by how its two values go together beyond what their own
 *   shares explain: the log odds ratio of the cell's two-by-two table (the `combo` metric, history.ts), which a
 *   column's share moving on its own leaves where it was. It has its own history and its own normal range, as a
 *   value's share does. A day whose odds are far outside it is a combination that moved, told by the cell that moved
 *   most and by the rows it moved, against the rows the day's own counts and the usual odds predict: "TLS Fail with
 *   Encryption Pass: 60 (usually ~30)". Each column's own share may be as usual that day; that is the point. Nothing
 *   names the pair in advance: every pair the history keeps day by day is judged. A value hardly there today (or
 *   nearly everything) says nothing of how it goes with another: its cells are passed over, its own finding speaks.
 * - `unlikeNews`: the day as a whole against the days before, by an isolation forest (quality.ts) grown on each learned
 *   day's numbers (every counted value's share, each pair's larger cells' excess, the share dropped). A day the forest
 *   sets apart in fewer splits than it took for any day before it is unlike them all, told with the numbers that set it
 *   apart most. The line is the days' own: each day before is scored by the trees it was not grown on, and today must
 *   score past every one of them (and past 0.5, the forest's own line for a point no quicker to isolate than the rest).
 *
 * Both are told as findings of the values cell (story.ts CELL_KINDS), never folded under a cause, and hold a day as
 * anything wrong does: a combination five points off is something wrong, two unusual; a day unlike the days before is
 * unusual. No DOM, no engine.
