/**
 * The days a flow's data is known to differ on, and a day's day last year to compare it with (ADR 0010 §2). A day is
 * `YYYY-MM-DD`, a date in the calendar's zone. Every function takes the flow's calendar, `US_NYC_1` by default, which is
 * the calendar every flow had before ADR 0010 and the one a legacy document keeps:
 *
 * - `none`: no built-in days.
 * - `us/1`: the US federal holidays, a weekend one on the weekday it is observed.
 * - `us-nyc/1`: `us/1` plus Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and the day after Thanksgiving; and around some of them days
 *   that are no holidays but no ordinary days either, as a holiday's window in forecasting has it: the holiday season
 *   from December 23 to January 3, the week of July 4th, the day before Thanksgiving and the weekend after it, and the
 *   weekends before Memorial Day and Labor Day.
 *
 * A base carries a version: a build that adds a day to a built-in list makes `/2`, and a flow keeps the days it was
 * judged by until its document says otherwise. A flow adds its own days (ADR 0010 §2, phase 3):
 *
 * - Recurring days, by a day of the month (`day`, negative from the month's end) or by the weekday that falls `between`
 *   two days of it, in every month or the months listed. One listed month makes a yearly day, judged as a holiday is,
 *   against last year's (`holidaysOf` names it); any other recurs more often and is judged against its occurrences
 *   before (`recurringOf`, `occurrencesBefore`, normal.ts's occurrences' guess). `around` puts the days before and after
 *   it in its window, each judged against the same day of the window the time before.
 * - Windows, spans of the year (`MM-DD` to `MM-DD`, across the new year when `to` comes first), as the holiday season.
 * - Dates, one-off: left out of learning and named on the day, judged as any other day (`datedOf`).
 *
 * No DOM, no engine.
