/**
 * smaltfl's runtime plugin (smaltdb plugin API v1). It runs inside the engine, next to the data: in the browser in
 * the engine worker (`serve({ plugins: [smaltfl] })`), in Node with `Database.open…(…, { plugins: [smaltfl] })`.
 *
 * Methods, called with `callPlugin('smaltfl', name, args)` (or `runFlow` / `verifyRun` from the core):
 *   run [plan, { smaltdb, context,    → RunResult     run a flow plan; only what changed is rebuilt, and with a
 *        stage, from }]                               publish block only what nothing holds is published (ADR 0009);
 *                                                     staged, a derived run, held until its decision is released
 *   release [ReleaseInput]            → ReleaseResult publish a held run's outputs as a recorded decision says (a
 *                                                     fill or the part that arrived: its derived run; a withdrawal:
 *                                                     the versions before a fill), or refuse, saying why; refusals
 *                                                     are kept too (ADR 0009 §5, amendment 1 S10)
 *   verify [run, { smaltdb, level }]  → VerifyResult  check a run's hashes, recompute it, decode its files again
 *   measure [{ table, settings }]     → Measures      a watched source's load measured before its run (ADR 0010 §6),
 *                                                     copied and hashed as its snapshot will be; cached by the file's
 *                                                     sha256 and the settings, which the run takes
 *   pin [name, bytes, sha256]         → { sha256 }    hash a source file in the engine, refuse a mismatch, serve it
 *                                                     as smaltfl:<name> (ADR 0006 §3); null bytes unpin it
 *   manifest [run]                    → RunManifest   a stored run's manifest
 *   names                             → { datasets, releases, holds, repairs }  what each dataset name shows,
 *                                                     by which run and release, every release, what held each run,
 *                                                     and the derived runs, repairs and withdrawals: an audit bag's
 *                                                     engine/ files
 *   act [ActInput]                    → Edit          check an action and record its edit or refusal
 *   edits / verifyEdits               → Edit[] / …    the hash chain of edits, and its check
 *
 * Like every plugin, it imports nothing from the engine at run time, only types.
