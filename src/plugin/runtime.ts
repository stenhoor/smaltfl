/**
 * Running a flow plan in the engine (ARCHITECTURE.md §5): snapshot the sources, type every node, key it, then build
 * each stored node that has no version yet, in one statement with its folded inputs. Dataset names move to the new
 * versions only when everything has run, in one transaction, so a failed run leaves the previous versions current.
 *
 * A plan with a publish block (plan/1, ADR 0009) can hold: its checks (with `checks` in `hold`) count without
 * throwing, each watched source is judged by the page's claim, and what holds keeps its outputs back. A held run is
 * built, checked, hashed and stored like any other, its versions staged; only the outputs nothing holds are pointed,
 * and a release (release.ts) publishes the rest when a person decides. A plan without the block runs as it always did.
 *
 * A derived run (`stage`, ADR 0009 amendment 1 S4) holds every output whatever else holds: it is a fill, or the part
 * that arrived, of a held day, and only a decision releases it. Its donors are judged by their claims, as watched
 * sources are. A plan whose fill step fills a day runs only so, and every output a fill step reaches carries
 * `filled_from`, or the run is refused (S1, Q-65).
