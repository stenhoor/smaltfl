/**
 * Verifying a run (ARCHITECTURE.md §6, ADR 0006 §5), at three levels:
 * - **stored:** the manifest still has its hash and agrees with the plan it names (coherent); the plan and the flow
 *   document it was translated from are stored and have their hashes, and the document translates to the plan
 *   (flow); every key recomputes (key); every version the run stored, snapshots included, still has its recorded
 *   content hash; each dataset name the run made current still shows that version, through the exact view the runtime
 *   writes (published); the run it chains to is there with that hash (previous); and rows in and out add up
 *   (accounting). Against accidents and naive edits only: whoever can write the whole store can rewrite it
 *   consistently.
 *   A run of a plan with a publish block (ADR 0009 §11) is also checked *held*: its stored holds are what its
 *   manifest's counts and its stored claims hold (each claim judged again against the manifest: its day, its
 *   history's file, the snapshot's rows), and every output it held that a name shows was released, by a release of
 *   this run, with this manifest and key and a decision's leaf, so a held output pointed by hand fails, under this
 *   run's number or under one that is no run, or a run that didn't make that version. A derived run (ADR 0009
 *   amendment 1 S4) is held by its fill and its donors too, computed again the same way; one released with a repair is
 *   checked *repair* (S11): its document is the repair of its held run's, it read the donor's file the repair names,
 *   and it read the held run's snapshot of the watched source.
 * - **rerun:** recomputing every stored node from the run's snapshots, with the same plan, gives the same content
 *   hashes and the same expectation counts. The recomputed rows go to temporary tables, which are dropped after.
 * - **rederive:** the source files the run read are still pinned with the hashes it recorded, each source is still the
 *   external table over its file, and decoding them again (the engine hashing the bytes it opens) gives the snapshots
 *   it read (file); then the rerun.
