# ADR 0008: The day's news, drawn

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-11-07
- **Builds on:** the news and normal ranges (src/core/news.ts, src/core/normal.ts; docs/SCENARIO.md §8), ADR 0006 §9
  (the integrity seal kept apart from the health marks)
- **Amended by:** [ADR 0009](0009-paused-not-published.md) §12: a held day waits for a decision, and a day shows its
  own run, published or staged; amendment 1 below (round 4): an hour fall's part that kept arriving, a held part drawn
  as kept, the episode chip's days, and the day by day's scale

## Context

The owner: "It feels just a little bit wordy … I want it to be immediately obvious to the user through visuals and not
like paragraphs of text. If we have to explain something by a paragraph of text, we're not doing a very good job
visually. The user should be able to understand things with a visual, maybe one or two sentences, and if they need
detailed explanation, that's when they'd have to interact with the site, like clicking something. And even in those
detailed sections, I really want to rely more on the visual."

Measured at phone size (390 px): the News tab for Fri Sep 22, 2023 was 3,217 words, 59 paragraphs over 25 words and
32 charts: one alert and 31 notes, each a card with a title, two or three sentences, a four-week sparkline, the same
40-word explanation of the band under every chart (37% of the words), and four to six buttons (148 on the screen). A
calm day was 558 words. Thu Sep 21's most important finding, the hour the trips fall, had no chart at all. Nov 15,
2022 led with "Extras $2.50 on 0.01% of trips" and never named Vendor 1 at the top.

Research (six angles, each checked against its sources: data-observability products, profiling tools, visualization
research, automated-insight interfaces, glanceable and mobile design, and a visual for each kind of finding), audits
of every screen at phone size, and a map of the code and the data led to a brief, three competing designs drawn as
phone mockups on the real days, and judges reading them in five seconds, with the words masked, and in detail.

The history also showed the incidents differently from how the news told them. On Fri Sep 22, 2023, 4,613 of the
4,633 trips were Flex Fare trips (payment type 0, five fields blank), and a Friday usually brings about that many: the
Flex Fare trips arrived as usual and every other trip almost stopped (20 where about 110,000 are usual). The checks
dropped 46% of the day's rows, past their 10% limit, but 2,116 rows is fewer than a usual Friday drops: the share
passed the limit because the kept rows were missing, not because bad rows came. On Nov 15, 2022 vendor 1 sent 3 trips
where about 35,000 are usual, and everything else held.

## Decision

1. **A day's news is a story** (src/core/story.ts, pure and tested): one cause, told as a population or a time, and
   every finding sorted by what the cause explains. The cause, in this order: a refused file; the hour the trips fall
   (hours); a split, the part of the trips with one coded value that held while everything else moved, or that
   vanished or surged while everything else held; an amount with no part to blame; a held gate; else the first finding
   that stands alone. The story is computed per viewer (the columns their policy removes are left out of findings,
   splits and predictions), and every summary reads it: the News tab, the canvas's health dots, the loads strip, the
   tab badge and the header.

2. **A split** is told when one side is within two thirds to one and a half of its usual count and the other is off by
   twice or more, the moved side carries at least 40% of the day's change and 200 trips, and the named side is the
   smaller one and not a blank, so the head names a population ("Flex Fare", "Vendor 1"), never its symptom ("Stored
   and forwarded N"). It is considered on days with a volume finding or two findings of something wrong or unusual
   among the values. Its usual count is the one it was judged on (the value's usual share of the trips a day like it
   has). A split states composition, not a reason: never "because" or "caused by". A value told together with the
   fields blank on its rows (payment type 0 with five fields blank: the Flex Fare trips) is that population: when
   nothing else is the cause and everything else kept to its usual count, it is the day's cause, headed by its share
   ("More Flex Fare trips: 5.3%", its range on the visual), and what it predicts follows from it (Mon Sep 18, 2023's
   "Stored and forwarded N: 94%" is those trips going blank). The split's twice-apart test isn't asked again: the
   finding's own range has judged the part.

3. **Four tiers.** Absorbed: it restates the cause (the amount, the split's own column, the fields blank on its rows).
   Follows: the cause predicts its count (the held part at its usual mix, the rest scaled to what arrived, by the
   history's long-run counts of the two values together, within three sampling errors and a typical miss); a time's
   quantile the day's trips by hour predict; the rows the checks dropped, at no more than a day like it drops. Same
   day: it can't be tested or the prediction missed, but it is no bigger than what the cause moved. Standalone:
   anything else. New values, new pairs, schema changes, integrity and the gate never fold. A folded finding is told
   as a note, with its severity before folding kept.

4. **The gate** is drawn as the share the checks dropped against their limit, and under it the rows they dropped
   against the rows a day like it drops, so a share past its limit because the kept rows went missing reads
   differently from one past it because bad rows came. On such a day the verb is "Tell the source", not "Add a check".
   New count metrics (`count`, `droppedRows`, `ruleRows`, scale `count`) give those rows their usual ranges; metrics are
   not hashed, so no encoding changes. A gate within one point below its limit is drawn too ("near"), and a share is
   never printed equal to the limit it passed or missed; a share of the checks is printed to one decimal everywhere,
   two within a point of the limit, and its gap to the limit with it, in the sheet always and on the card where the
   checks held or came near ("45.7% … 35.7 pt over"). Each bar says what it counts ("46% of arrived rows dropped",
   "2,116 rows dropped"); the limit is a tall solid tick and the share's end a pointer (‖ only ever means held). Within
   two points of the limit the share is drawn again on a printed zoom (0–20% for a 10% limit) and its margin said to
   the share's own decimals ("10.45% … 0.45 pt over"); on the full bar its end sits 3 px clear of the tick on its side.

5. **Words.** A head is at most six words and carries the number or the time ("Only Flex Fare records arrived", "Trips
   fall to trickle from 13:00": a fall that runs to the day's end, with trips in every hour after it and under a tenth
   of a usual day's in them, is a fall to a trickle, so it reads as most trips falling away and the rest still coming,
   never as the file cut off, which the rate in the head, "Trips fall to ~330/h", still read as; a fall to more than
   that is headed by its rate; "Vendor 1 sent almost nothing", "Normal for MLK Day"); a finding's title at most eight, with
   its measured number and value names ("Payment type Credit card: 0.2% (usually 75–80%)"), and as a head it leaves its
   "(usually …)" to the visual under it when six words won't hold it; its detail at most one sentence of twenty words,
   shown only on tap, every word of it from the figures with a tolerance ("as usual" only within 5% of usual and inside
   its range, "within its usual range" further off, "almost stopped" only under a twentieth of usual on a day with no
   hour the trips fall, which is said as a fall from its hour). A share outside its range is printed with the decimals that keep it from reading
   as the range's edge. The method (the band, its weights, typical misses, the denominators) is written once, behind
   (i). Banned at a glance: "because", "caused by", "feed stopped", "disappeared", "The band". Budgets: an incident day
   60 words at a glance, an unusual one 45, a calm one 16, a day back to normal 24.

6. **One cause card.** The head, one chip (the episode's day and the trips short so far, "Day 2 · ~187k short", or
   "Back to normal"'s "after Thu 13:00–Sun", which names the episode's days, ADR 0009 §12; a tap opens the episode's
   sheet), with one line under it saying whether anything is left to do:
   "Nothing to do · Thu published short, Fri–Sun held", a held load being never published and nothing waiting on a
   person to release it; never the weather, §11), the day's count on a line with its usual range (the
   amount line, under the head on every day, carrying the day's own change, "−65%", when the count is outside its
   range and the head doesn't say it, named "whole day −65%" beside a head about the hours from a fall), one visual
   chosen by the cause (the part and the rest on one bar at one scale, 6 px apart, today's ink over a dashed usual, so a
   part that held and a rest that stopped read at their real sizes, each labelled "10,518 · usual ~4.5k" so it can't
   read as a fraction, trips beyond usual real trips filled in a lighter tone of the ink past a thin notch, said under
   them when the surge is the news, "+6k over usual", a sliver of them under 6 px taking no notch; 24 hour bars over a
   ghost of a usual day, the short hours' trips one dark ribbon never under 5 px, the trips missing one wash 3 px clear
   of it whose dashed edge runs up its sides and along the usual skyline, never along the trickle, labelled "~77k
   fewer" (the hours are short, never missing: "missing" over a ribbon read as the file cut off), the first short hour
   marked by the wash's edge and a short mark under its label (a rule through the plot read as the file cut there), and
   under the axis the trickle zoomed in its own hours' columns, an outlined panel under their span, each hour a bar on
   the zoom's own scale from 0, their mean a solid line labelled with the rate beside the panel ("still ~330/h"), the
   axis's hours under the panel, so each hour after the fall keeps a bar and a trickle reads as trips still coming
   every hour and not as the end of the file (at the chart's scale ~330 an hour against a usual ~9k is under 3 px; a
   ribbon with its rate on a bracket, and then a panel widened under a wedge, which read as a range slider, both still
   read as the file cut off; a fall early in the morning, with no room beside the panel for the rate, keeps it on a
   bracket over the ribbon), and when the hours before
   the fall ran a twentieth of the day or more off usual, a bracket over them saying by how much ("~8.3k above usual",
   Sat Sep 17, 2022, so ~52k fewer and the whole day's −42% are both read true); a day told by its hours shows the
   part and the rest beside them only when the part moved too; a strip of days each with its own range, 9 px at least,
   its tick 2 px on a band under 12 px and the band's edge drawn over the tick, four weeks on an amount day and the week
   on a calm one, an episode's days marked), the gate when it
   held, came near, or the day had something wrong, what it reaches ("Paused · 3 outputs waiting" on a day held, ADR 0009 §12; "Outputs built from a short day", never "published" alone; §10), the folded findings as one row at a glance,
   ↳ and its first change named with the rest counted ("Passengers 1 share + 27 more": what it holds, never "16
   changes this explains · shares" alone), that opens in place into its two groups, each headed by what it is ("16
   changes this explains · shares · values gone · times", "12 more this day"), their compact rows a column's together,
   three and then "Show all", each today against its usual; and one verb with the others behind ⋯. An unusual head
   whose day's total is in its range and whose one verb is marking it says under it "Total in range · nothing to do",
   so its amber can't read as a broken feed to act on (New Year's Day 2024's Flex Fare surge; never on a day whose
   total is outside its range, Sun Jan 7's fewer trips); marking a day is "Mark as expected (optional)", never "OK this
   day", which read as a sign-off. The part a head names is glossed a tap away where it first appears, from what the
   ontology says of it, in twenty words at most (ontology.ts glossOf: "Flex Fare: payment type 0, booked in an app at a
   price set up front, not by the meter"; "Vendor 1: Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC, the technology company whose
   system in the cab recorded the trip"), with whom "Tell the source" reaches when it is among the day's verbs (whoever
   publishes the source, never the part's company). The health row (§11) sits in the card,
   after its visuals and before the gate. Then at most two more stories, and counted rows for the rest and the notes,
   each row carrying the mark its findings carry in the health row. A tap opens a sheet that is visual too, its
   sections in the cause's order (a day told by its hours leads with them): a waterfall from a usual day to this one (a
   long name wraps; on a day told by its hours, its steps the same windows as the hour chart, "before 15:00" and "from
   15:00"; a step within its own usual range a neutral grey step, never the dashed wash of trips missing), the
   part's own days (its axis printed, each day's tick coloured only when outside that day's range, and, where its count
   has no range of its own, the range its split is judged on: New Year's Day 2024's Flex Fare at 2.3k–8.6k), its
   column's composition usual and today only when the part's own count moved (a part that held reads as a share that
   surged when the rest fell: Thu Sep 21, 2023's Flex Fare, 3.9% to 11.1% on its usual 4,657 trips), its count beside
   its share ("Flex Fare 13.0% · 10,518") (the part labelled, over the bar when it's narrow, a vendor named beside its
   code, "Vendor 1 · Creative Mobile", as the hero bar names it too; a value gone today takes no width and is named
   under its bar), the split in one sentence; the episode's hours, its readout first saying
   the fall as the head does ("Thu from 13:00: 3,679 trips · usual ~80k (−95%)") and its shortfall an estimate with
   its bound in words ("~375k fewer (at least 270k)"), never the bound alone; the checks rule by rule against their usual rows, on one
   count scale over an incident's days so far, and the outputs the held run didn't publish. Numbers that sit beside a
   difference are rounded finely enough to subtract ("~68.5k" beside "+2k"); a waterfall's labels are whole counts in
   one format on every day, adding up exactly and ending on the count the card prints ("114,913 −110,137 −143 →
   4,633"; never "Today 6k" beside a head's 5,732).

7. **Marks** carry severity by shape and fill first and colour third (the tokens' hues are too close in greyscale):
   something wrong is a filled hexagon with "!", unusual an outlined triangle on a wash, a note a hollow ring (the shape of a number outside its range that isn't news; never a filled dot, which reads as a badge to clear), ok no mark,
   held ‖, explained ↳, marked as expected ✓. Folded findings keep their shape in grey. A number outside its range
   without being news is a shape, a ring, never a severity's colour; the day picked on a History chart takes its
   verdict's colour, the one its News, the strip and the calendar give it. A range's ends and a usual notch are soft,
   thin and in the band's own edge; only a real limit is a heavy tick. Counts start at zero (a History chart of a count
   too: Thu Sep 21, 2023's 41,939 never sits on a floor of 37k); shares sit
   on 0–100% or a printed zoom; each day draws its own range; usual is a light ghost behind today's ink, its edge 3:1
   against the card in both themes (tracks and control borders too; hairlines 1.8:1), never thinner than today's mark
   and 4 px more, grown away from a value outside it so the gap stays true. A strip of days carries a one-line key
   where it is first shown ("usual", "actual"; counted in the glance budget; four weeks add the weekday its darker
   bands are, "Sundays"); in a sheet a second row keys what else it draws (a day with no usual of its own, each mark
   with its word); the canvas's loads strip keys each mark it draws with its word, "holiday season" apart from
   "holiday"; and the day after an episode keys ‖ ⚑ ✕ in its line, each beside the days it marks, at no cost in words,
   and its strip keys the episode's ! ("wrong") and its days not run; an episode's sheet keys its bars as a strip does.
   Every band's edge is 3:1 or more against the card in both themes even drawn at a phone's 1x, the dark theme's band
   fill lifted to show as a shape; the gate's zoom draws its two sides as lines; the History calendar's day on screen
   is a heavy ring. Dashes mean absent and nothing else: a
   limit is a solid tick, a guess a lighter solid line, a grouped card a tinted border, a link a solid hairline. Marks in
   tabs and strips are 14 px; a mark for a number that isn't zero is never under 3 px.

8. **A share or a level is told only a typical miss past its range's edge** (counts from the edge), so a number hugging
   the edge isn't news. Over Jan 2023 to Jan 2024 the days are 6 something wrong (as before), 27 unusual (33 before),
   125 with notes only and 238 calm (and 2 back to normal).

9. **A change that has lasted** stays a note, and its first day is no longer said in words: the current rule judges the
   days before against today's range and claims starts that aren't ("Since Nov 3" for vendor 1, who stopped on Mon Nov
   14). Its chart shows when it began until that rule is done again. The day's trips are judged the right way: a rise or
   fall is told as a note, unless it is something wrong, when four of the seven days before were outside their own
   ranges the same way, and the day is headed "Busier than usual for days" (or "Quieter"), never "A normal Wednesday"
   beside a count outside its range. The weeks after Labor Day 2022 were the case (no last year in the history to learn
   the season from: Sep 7–16 all 11–21% above weeks of August; Sep 14–16 2023, with last year to go by, were inside
   their ranges): Sep 11–16, 2022 become notes, Sep 7–10 stay unusual. Over Jan 2023 to Jan 2024 no day changes; over
   2022 to Jan 2024, 8 days go from unusual to notes (those six and Jan 10 and 13, 2022, weeks of fewer trips).

10. **A day shows that day** (src/core/days.ts). Loads arrive one a day, as a feed brings them, and readers get only a
    day that isn't held: while a day waits for a decision they keep the last day published (ADR 0009). Every view reads
    one run: the viewed day's own, published or staged. A held day's own rows are built, checked and kept staged, and
    every panel showing them sits under a full-width hatched bar ("Thu 21 built, not published · readers see Wed 20",
    in plain words, never "Staged"; at the top of the panel, as on the Dropped tab); views of what
    readers get (who sees what, the objects actions act on) read the published names and say so ("As published · Wed
    20"). Only a day with no run of its own (a refused file) falls back to the newest run of the latest day before it
    that was published in this visit, never a later day's (stepping to Tue 26 and back to a refused day shows the day
    before it, not Tue 26's; a day reached straight from the episode's first shows that first day, said so). A panel
    whose rows are another day's carries that day as a full-width hatched bar ("Rows from Thu Sep 21 · the last day
    published"), under the day's own figures where a panel has both (the gate, then the last day's dropped rows), and
    the day's marks and badges are never put beside those rows. A flow that doesn't say what holds it keeps the gate
    as it was: a run the checks hold builds nothing, its held line says what stopped it and what the outputs keep
    ("‖ Held at trips_valid · outputs keep Thu 21"), its rows are the last day published, and a step after the one
    that held says "not built today", hatched, with no dot or seal from another day.
    Nothing after the viewed day is drawn as known: the episode's hours run from its first day to the viewed one (Sep 21
    shows Thu, Sep 22 Thu–Fri, the viewed day framed and its readout first: "Fri: 4,633 trips · usual ~115k (−96%)"),
    its shortfall counts those days only, the day it began as its head counts it (Sep 21: "~77k fewer", as its hour
    chart's "~77k fewer"); a History chart, its weather and its calendar end at the viewed day, drawing no band,
    guess, rain or month after it; the loads strip leaves them unmarked, a band and no count, whatever the visit
    ran. The episode chips keep a mark: they are how to get to the incidents, each marked by its worst day (ADR 0009 §12). The History calendar gives each day the
    verdict its News tells (the same story, findings marked as expected left so, a refused file first), the viewed
    day's at once, ringed apart from its own colour; it checks the days to the viewed one a few at a time while the page
    is idle, on after its tab closes, and says "Checking every day · 276 of 693" with a bar until every one is checked,
    never a count of wrong days before then ("693 days to Thu Sep 21 · 23 wrong · 36 unusual" after). Days after the
    viewed one are neither drawn nor counted. A key says what each cell is, and each year's block names its year on its
    first row. The band's "outside last year" is another measure (days outside their range), said as such. A day with
    something wrong shows its checks whether they held, came near or passed ("Checks passed", Sat Sep 17, 2022), their
    sheet titled with the share their bars say and marked as the checks are (wrong when held, unusual when near the
    limit or their own findings are, no mark when they passed as usual), and says what its outputs are: on a day paused
    "Paused · 3 outputs waiting" until a person decides, then "Published as is" or "Not published" (ADR 0009 §12);
    with a flow that doesn't hold, "Outputs not published" when held; else what they were built from, "Outputs built from
    a short day", "Outputs built without Vendor 1" (under a tenth of its usual count came, as its head's "almost
    nothing") or "with Vendor 1 short" (Aug 10, 2022: 85% short), published ones ticked in their icon, not drawn in a
    severity colour; its boxes carry up to three outputs, so their number is said only past three. A tap lists them,
    each with its rows and a tap to its card. An output (or a step after the load) built from such a day says what its
    load lacked above its own rows' news, with its head's figures ("Built from a load 95% short from 13:00", "Its load:
    Trips fall 95% from 13:00"; hours are short, never missing, as trips still came in them), for the day its rows are:
    on a held day its own staged rows (with a flow that doesn't hold, the last day published, itself short at times).
    Holding such outputs was Q-45: ADR 0009 answers it, a day that is off is paused, not published. One colour
    rule: a canvas card's line and its badge take the card's own severity and nothing else does (a routine count, such
    as Nov 15, 2022's ordinary 4.6% dropped, is neutral ink); the status line after a run takes its day's verdict,
    held or published alike; and no tick (seal) shows on what the load reaches when the day has no run of its own.

11. **The card's context, its health row, and the sheet's chrome.** The weather is context and never takes the chip a
    cause takes: on a day that isn't wrong, today's snow (and the day before's when the day's trips are the news) is a
    note at the card's end, tagged as context ("Context ❄ 1.5 cm today · 7.2 cm Sat", Sun Jan 7, 2024; Sat Jan 6 says
    "Context ❄ 7.2 cm today" under "A normal Saturday"; its title "Snow, for context: not tested as a cause"), nothing to
    tap, the tag and the note counted at a glance; not on a day with something wrong (its cause
    is told) nor on the day after an episode (it says what is left of it): their weather is on the weather's card. The
    detail draws it under the eight weeks of trips, in their columns and with their dates and its 0, headed "Snow, for
    context", with no sentence, so Saturday's 7.2 cm over a normal Saturday is there to see. The
    health row is headed once ("Health", counted) and is the same on every day: five cells (File, Amount, Hours, Values,
    Shape), no mark where nothing is out of the ordinary, ↳ where the cause groups them, and each a tap from what it
    measured: the file check in words over the list → file → load chain ("5,732 trips in the day's file, its bytes as
    published"), the amount line and four weeks, the day's hours over a usual day's, and every finding of its kinds,
    the ones the cause absorbed too, worst first; a ring in it is the ring on "7 notes" under it. It sits in the cause
    card after the visuals, so a day with something wrong keeps it in the first screen. Every finding is in one tier,
    and the rows on screen add up to what was found (Thu Sep 21, 2023: 1 cause, 2 absorbed, 6 explained, 8 the same
    day: 17); what the cause absorbed is one tap away in its health cell. An episode's chip draws its days so far as a
    calendar page, the viewed day dark, and says its shortfall so far (days.shortfall, as its hours count it), so day 3
    reads apart from day 2; each day's trips against its guess are in its accessible name and the episode's sheet
    (ADR 0009 §12). Once the source is told on a day of the episode the card says "Source told on Fri"
    and its verb moves to "Open an incident", "Tell the source again" behind ⋯; each verb's accessible name and title
    say what it does and whom it reaches. "How it's judged" draws what the day's range is learned from, inside its
    frame: the six weekdays before as dots, the day last year as a diamond with its date, each group named, and today's
    band and value; two sentences built from what was used (days.judgedWords: "the 6 Saturdays before; no data a year
    ago" in September 2022, "the 3 days around it last year", a holiday named against itself last year), the band said
    wide when it is more than half its middle across, with the reason its inputs show; the rest of the method behind
    "More on the method"; "About this flow" says the same.
    The sheet's head fits 390 px: the day on its own row, a greyed "‹ first day" on the first load (no arrow there read
    as broken) and no arrow past the last; what it reads and what
    reads it under it, each chip cut short and two or more folded into one ("‹ 2 inputs"); the tabs scrolled to the one
    chosen with a tab's room either side, their edges faded with a chevron while tabs lie past them; a table wider than
    the phone keeps its first column and fades at the edge it scrolls past. A held gate is said from its figures wherever its message would
    show ("Held at trips_valid: 10.45% of arrived rows dropped · limit 10%"), and the runtime prints its counts with
    thousands separators. A part's mark sits against its own name on the bar's outer side.

12. **The other tabs and the canvas, drawn the same way.** The checks' rules are one label and one order wherever
    they are drawn (story.ruleUsual, ruleOrder: the most rows first, warn-only rules last): "never fails" for a rule no
    day to this one failed (in_month, whose band of half a row printed "usual 1–1"), one number when both ends round
    to it, and nothing after a count with no range. A count past its usual range runs on past a notch as an outlined
    box, as trips beyond usual do (Jan 1, 2024: 6,942 rows dropped, Distance 4,305, Duration 1,553), on the rules and
    the gate's count bar. The checks' head says its share as its bar does ("Passed: 8.6% dropped"); its (i) shows how
    the rows dropped are judged; its sheet adds what the card lacks (the rows dropped day by day, what a held run kept
    back, the rows a tap away). A share that isn't nothing never prints "0.0%" ("<0.1%"). A suggested check leads with
    a plain sentence, its count and its reason, the SQL folded under it; a documented code column gets its documented
    codes, never a bound (weather codes over 12 are rain and snow, said so), and a bound is suggested only for a tail
    fewer than 1% of the rows reach, counted over every row; a file of many days says "in this file", not "today". A
    table that measures an effect against a baseline (a `vs_<baseline>` column, weather_effect's vs_dry; core/effect.ts)
    says "No effect to measure today" when its rows are all the baseline, and draws each ratio as a bar from the
    baseline's 1×, left for fewer and right for more, on a doubling scale with its ticks printed ("dry 1×", "4×"), so
    +1% and −13% read apart. The weather's News draws its day by the hour in the trips' hour shape (rain and snow from 0,
    the temperature a line with its lowest and highest hours in whole degrees, never "−0 °C"), and a note's sentence is
    said once. A column whose values tie says "all equal"; a column's top value is its name and share apart, named as the
    news names it ("Curb Mobility · 75%", "$0.50 · 96%", "Flex Fare · 100%", a zone by its name where it fits); the Columns tab keys its marks (↳ ▲▼ ○) and every sample says its size ("1,976 of
    81,013 rows"); a rename is said as one ("Renamed LocationID → location_id"); a dropped row's why is said from its
    values and what its rule needs ("Duration 19 s (needs 1 min–3 h)"); History's chips are named by the number each
    draws ("Extras $2.50 share"), its picker a neutral control. On a phone the canvas stacks its sections one under the
    next, two cards a row, from the top (an arrangement is never stacked; an edge into a lower row runs down the gap
    above it); a card's line fits it ("−30% trips", "Flex Fare trips: 5.3%"), a step's badge counts the rows it left
    out and its line their share, and the loads strip keys its holiday line.

## Consequences

- news.ts finds; story.ts tells. newsOf no longer folds findings ("Likely from …" is gone); its titles and details
  are short and carry their numbers; the hours finding keeps its hours for its bars; findings told together keep their
  members' numbers and are told by the value that names them, with its own numbers, never "N values move together · N
  trips fewer". A share's detail counts its trips today against its usual share of the same trips ("9 of today’s trips
  with it; about 3,360 at its usual share"), never "N fewer than a day like it": a share can fall while its trips rise
  (New Year's Day 2024's credit cards), and on a short day a day like it's count is mostly the day's own shortfall.
- The population rule and the lasting trips (§2, §9) leave the days of §8 as they were: 6 something wrong, 27 unusual,
  363 with nothing unusual to tell.
- src/app/viz.ts draws the visuals as SVG strings with role=img and an aria-label stating the finding with its
  numbers, tested in Node.
- The header says the day's head, not build statistics (they are on the Runs view and in the line's title); the
  status line carries `data-run` and `data-state` for tools. The flow's lede and legend sit behind "About this flow".
  The loads strip draws each day's trips against its own range, with its mark.
- Left for later, each its own decision: redoing `lasting()` (each past day against its own range) with a backtest;
  monthly joint counts of every coded column with the payment type and the vendor in the history, so Extras' changes
  can be tested against a split; per-borough counts, so a split can name a borough; a gate that holds outputs built
  from a day with an alert upstream (a plan change); "a share that has never been 0 alerts at 0"; storing a multi-day
  incident as one record entry; the Columns, History, Odd rows and Dropped tabs drawn as fully as the News (§12 made
  them plainer); a weather_effect whose baseline is the history's dry hours (on a one-day load its join
  to dry hours at the same hour of day keeps no wet hour, so it never measures anything: a change to the document).

## Amendment 1: hour-fall days as they were, and pictures that tell days apart (round 4, 2026-11-09)

Counted from the two hour-fall days' own files (pickup hour × payment type): on Thu Sep 21, 2023 every payment but Flex
Fare stopped by 13:06 (633 trips that hour, 37 in the rest of the day) while Flex Fare kept arriving (4,657 for the day,
inside its range); on Sat Sep 17, 2022 nothing but Flex Fare came after 15:00. Readers who saw "stopped after 13:00" were
right about everything but Flex Fare; "trips fall to a trickle" was true of all trips and hid it.

1. **The part that kept arriving** (story.ts `keptOf`). Given the viewed load's own rows by hour and by the split's
   column (`StoryOptions.byHour`, counted through the plan by emit.ts `emitHourValues`, each stamp's hour read as its
   measures read it, measures.ts `hourValuesOf`), when they add up to the day's hours in every hour, the fall runs to the
   day's end, and the rows in the hours after the fall's own hour are 95% one value (`KEPT_SHARE`; a blank never), the
   head names it, as the day after does: "Only Flex Fare after 13:00". The hour chart stacks the two parts on one scale
   over the one usual the card counts on: the part as one teal band from 0h to 24h (5 px at least where it had rows),
   everything else standing on it at its true height (3 px at least) until it stops at the fall, the trips missing the
   wash with its dashed skyline, the before-bracket as §6 says, and a key ("Flex Fare", "everything else") in place of
   the trickle's rate. The rest in an hour after the fall under a twentieth of its rows draws nothing (the head says
   "only"); the aria counts them. The split's sentence says "kept arriving … everything else stopped after 13:00". A day
   where the rest fell but didn't stop, or a day whose load wasn't run here, keeps §5's head and §6's chart.
   The history keeps no hour × value counts, so the claim a run is judged by (and `audit --history`'s retelling) keeps
   the history's head; the hour × value counts belong in the history's measures when its format next changes (a new
   measures encoding, with its vectors).
2. **A part that held is drawn as kept**: the split bar draws the named part that held in the same teal, so "one part
   held, the rest stopped" (Fri Sep 22, 2023) no longer looks like "one part vanished" (Mon Nov 14, 2022). Checks that
   held the day too are headed "Checks held" with their ‖ every day they hold (ADR 0009 §12's lone ‖ while waiting went
   unread), and the pause row marks each reason ("Paused by ! trips, ‖ checks").
3. **The episode's chip** draws its days so far as blocks as wide as each day was short (16 px a whole usual day), the
   viewed day filled, a day this visit didn't run a grey dashed frame of the history's width, so day 3 reads apart from
   day 2 and the row's length is the total its words count (§11's calendar page stays where the days' trips aren't
   known). Its sheet says the estimate and its bound apart: "likely ~187k short so far · at least 130k".
4. **A finding's day by day** sits on a printed scale from 0 (a share's top in percent, a count's as a count: a labelled
   zoom, §7), and when today ran with the 14 days before and its band sits apart from them, says where they ran ("14 days
   before: 0%, as today"), so the strip and the note agree on what was usual lately.
5. **Symptoms follow their cause, and one severity rule (round 3 of judging, #21).** On a day held, or one whose story
   has something wrong, a finding that isn't the cause is an effect of it ("Card tip rate empty on 99.6% of zone hours"
   on trips_enriched when only Flex Fare arrived; "Passengers 1: 0.2%"): its card has no primary verb, its verbs wait
   behind a labelled ⋯ ("More"), and its detail leads with the pause's verb, Decide (or who decides), never "Open an
   incident" or "Mark as expected" of its own. The rows a check drops where it passed, and those a filter removes, are
   routine: What changed says them in neutral ink, its bar's dropped part too; amber stays for checks that held the run
   or came within a point of their limit (§10). A card's file seal ("checked back to the bytes") is an outlined tick in
   ink, never green beside a card's alert, and the canvas keys it in its corner ("file matches its list") whenever a card
   carries one. A share far from a band learned from last year but level with the 14 days before it is a lasting change,
   told as a note after the day it first crossed (ADR 0010 §5), with its strip saying where those days ran (4. above);
   the band itself, from normal.ts's year guess, is left to that model's own decision.
